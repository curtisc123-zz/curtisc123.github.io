          </header>

          <p class="wow bounceIn">Well, who am I even? I’ve got about 10 years experience as a web developer. I
              started my career in Kelowna BC at an agency as a designer and coder.
              I worked on a lot of stuff there. I moved to Vancouver in 2012 for a job
              and for my now wife’s animation career.</p>
          <p class="wow bounceIn">I’m not just a developer though, I like lots of things. I’m an avid movie-goer
            and asipring photographer, filmmaker and pianist. I dabble in video games, a bit of a
            beer conniseur and I’m way too into comics and pop culture.</p>

            Technology in Kelowna BC. While I didn't puruse this in the end, the experience was invaluable to my career.

          <p>Navigator Multimedia in the hooouse! My first industry job.</p>
          <p class="timeline-item-snippet">My position here was to work as a developer
            and web/graphic designer. I was mostly
            slicing up PSD designs either myself or
            other designers had done. I also dabbled a
            bit in WordPress development and other
            custom CMS solutions. My main skills used
            here were HTML, CSS and jQuery.</p>

          <p>Major change ahead! Move to Vancouver. Begin work at Electronic Arts.</p>
          <p class="timeline-item-snippet">A lot to say about this one. I did a ton here! I mostly worked on FIFA as
            a front end developer on the Ultimate Team Companion App. This was a massive project that was
            completed by a team of six devs, and is still ongoing. It's a Cordova based mobile app written with a custom
            JS framework, and uses Less.js. My main role was to work on the CSS and markup, but I did work in the JS quite
            a bit. I also worked in their marketing department on easports.com using Angular.JS for a few months before getting a bit of Unity
            and C# experience. This was from working on a mobile game called Sundown Boogie Frights,
            which unfortunately is no longer live, on the EA Mobile Game team</p>

          <p>Let’s try start up life, eh? Head to Red Stamp Agency.</p>
          <p class="timeline-item-snippet">After gaining a metric f*** ton of experience at EA, I wanted to try
            something totally different. I met the great guys at Redstamp and worked with them for a little under
            a year. I coded websites for clients, marketing materials and did a bit of product work in Vue.js.
            While I ultimately decided the brand new start up life wasn't quite for me, I had a good experience
            and got to work with some very smart people.

          <p>BroadbandTV is calling! Head there as a senior front end developer.</p>
          <p class="timeline-item-snippet">My time at BBTV was a huge learning experience for me. I had my
            first real introduction into React and Chrome Extensions. I also began working as a Scrum Master
            and dev lead on a team working on a pretty large project. It was pretty chaotic for me in a good
            way. I worked and shipped 4 projects that are currently being used in the company. VISO Catalyst
            for Chrome, VISO, and two internal tools for sales.

          <p>Back to EA! At least for the next little while..until the next adventure!</p>
          <p class="timeline-item-snippet">I took a little break and needed to get back into something I know for awhile.
            I'm working again on the Ultimate Team Companion Apps now on a contract.
